**Information architecture:**

Universe is infinite, so direct your focus to the parallax experience here. Users engage with a webpage via mouse movement, causing elements to shift at different speeds, resulting in a dynamic and immersive visual experience. The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth.

**Design:**

JavaScript generates randomness within the realm of outer space, where depth corresponds with scaling and blurring effects. The button in the middle, barely visible, becomes evident upon hovering. Clicking generates a new landscape.
